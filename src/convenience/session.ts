/**
 * Session middleware provides a persistent data storage for your bot. You can
 * use it to let your bot remember any data you want, for example the messages
 * it sent or received in the past. This is done by attaching _session data_ to
 * every chat. The stored data is then provided on the context object under
 * `ctx.session`.
 *
 * > **What is a session?** Simply put, the session of a chat is a little
 * > persistent storage that is attached to it. As an example, your bot can send
 * > a message to a chat and store the ID of that message in the corresponding
 * > session. The next time your bot receives an update from that chat, the
 * > session will still contain that ID.
 * >
 * > Session data can be stored in a database, in a file, or simply in memory.
 * > grammY only supports memory sessions out of the box, but you can use
 * > third-party session middleware to connect to other storage solutions. Note
 * > that memory sessions will be lost when you stop your bot and the process
 * > exits, so they are usually not useful in production.
 *
 * Whenever your bot receives an update, the first thing the session middleware
 * will do is to load the correct session from your storage solution. This
 * object is then provided on `ctx.session` while your other middleware is
 * running. As soon as your bot is done handling the update, the middleware
 * takes over again and writes back the session object to your storage. This
 * allows you to modify the session object arbitrarily in your middleware, and
 * to stop worrying about the database.
 *
 * ```ts
 * bot.use(session())
 *
 * bot.on('message', ctx => {
 *   // The session object is persisted across updates!
 *   const session = ctx.session
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * It is recommended to make use of the `inital` option in the configuration
 * object, which correctly initializes session objects for new chats.
 *
 * You can delete the session data by setting `ctx.session` to `null` or
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * Check out the [documentation](https://grammy.dev/plugins/session.html) on the
 * website to know more about how sessions work in grammY.

 * their usage looks 100 % identical.
 *
 * Instead of directly querying the storage every time an update arrives, lazy
 * sessions quickly do this _once you access_ `ctx.session`. This can
 * significantly reduce the database traffic (especially when your bot is added
 * to group chats), because it skips a read and a wrote operation for all
 * updates that the bot does not react to.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // The options are identical
 * bot.use(lazySession({ storage: ... }))
 *
 * bot.on('message', async ctx => {
 *   // The session object is persisted across updates!
 *   const session = await ctx.session
 *   //                        ^
 *   //                        |
 *   //                       This plain property access (no function call) will trigger the database query!
 * })
 * ```
