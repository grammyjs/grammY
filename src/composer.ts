 * `await`ed.
 *

 * middleware is done executing, hence returning the control.

/**
 * Middleware for grammY, either as a function or as a container for a function.
 *
 * Simply put, middleware is just a fancy term for a _listener_. You can
 * register middleware on a bot to listen for updates. Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * bot.on('message', ctx => ctx.reply('I got your message!'))
 * //                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * //                ^
 * //                |
 * //               This is middleware!
 * ```
 *
 * Middleware receives one object that we call the _context object_. This is
 * another fancy term for a simple object that holds information about the
 * update you're processing. For instance, the context object gives you access
 * to the message that was sent to your bot (`ctx.message`), including the text
 * (or photo or whatever message the user has sent). The context object is
 * commonly named `ctx`.
 *
 * It also provides you with the `ctx.api` object that you also find on
 * `bot.api`. As a result, you can call `ctx.api.sendMessage` instead of
 * `bot.api.sendMessage`. This prevents you from having to pass around your
 * `bot` instance all over your code.
 *
 * Most importantly, the context object gives you a handful of really useful
 * shortcuts, such as a `reply` method (see above). This method is nothing else
 * than a wrapper around `ctx.api.sendMessage`—but with some arguments
 * pre-filled for you. As you can see above, you no longer have to specify a
 * `chat_id` or anything; the context object knows which chat it belongs to, so
 * when you call `reply`, the context will call `sendMessage` with the correct
 * `chat_id`, namely the one for the same chat that the incoming message
 * originates from. This makes it very convenient to reply to a message.
 *
 * Middleware is an extremely powerful concept and this short explanation only
 * scratched the surface of what is possible with grammY. If you want to know
 * more advanced things about middleware, check out the
 * [documentation](https://grammy.dev/guide/middleware.html) on the website.

     * _Not to be confused with the `router` plugin._
     *
     * This method is an alternative to the `router` plugin. It allows you to
     * branch between different middleware per context object. You can pass two
     * things to it:
     * 1. A routing function
     * 2. Different middleware identified by key
     *
     * The routing function decides based on the context object which middleware
     * to run. Each middleware is identified by a key, so the routing function
     * simply returns the key of that middleware.
     * ```ts
     * // Define different route handlers
     * const routeHandlers = {
     *   evenUpdates: (ctx: Context) => { ... }
     *   oddUpdates: (ctx: Context) => { ... }
     * }
     * // Decide for a context object which one to pick
     * const router = (ctx: Context) => ctx.update.update_id % 2 === 0
     *   ? 'evenUpdates'
     *   : 'oddUpdates'
     * // Route it!
     * bot.route(router, routeHandlers)
     * ```
     *
     * Optionally, you can pass a third option that is used as fallback
     * middleware if your route function returns `undefined`, or if the key
     * returned by your router has no middleware associated with it.
     *
     * This method may need less setup than first instantiating a `Router`, but
     * for more complex setups, having a `Router` may be more readable.

     * @param routeHandlers Handlers for every route
     * @param fallback Optional fallback middleware if no route matches
