# grammY code of conduct

## Who We Want to Be

We as a community want to be inclusive for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, language, personal appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are humans.
We meet each other with respect and dignity.

If it is not obvious what this means, here are a few examples of behavior that we do not tolerate.

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement

Admins enforce our standards of acceptable behavior.
They take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
When they take action, they will communicate this appropriately.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the administrators at <https://t.me/grammyjs>.
In the [chat](https://t.me/grammyjs), you can also notify the available administrators using the `/report` command.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Admins respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Guidelines

Admins will try to follow these guidelines when taking action.

- Above all, use human judgement which is appropriate for the situation.
- Warn or temp ban people who use inappropriate language or show other unwelcome behavior.
  If there is hope that the respective person can learn and avoid such behavior in the future, it is imperative to teach them rather than banning them.
- Be transparent about your actions, and provide necessary clarity why you performed them.
- Delete messages that are too harmful to stay online and be read by others.
  Only delete these messages, and no others, so that the context of your actions is preserved as much as possible.
