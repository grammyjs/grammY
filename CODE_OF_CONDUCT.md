# grammY code of conduct

## Who We Want to Be

We as a community want to be inclusive for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are humans.
We meet each other with respect and dignity.

If it is not obvious what this means, here are a few examples of behavior that we do not tolerate.

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement

Admins enforce our standards of acceptable behavior.
They take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
When they take action, they will communicate this appropriately.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the admins at <https://t.me/grammyjs>.
You can tag all available admins using the `/report` command.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Admins respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
